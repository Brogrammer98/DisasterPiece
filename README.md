Disasterpiece: CodeFunDo++

Our team aims to find better ways to save lives and prevent economic losses through mechanisms to predict natural disasters using deep learning applied to satellite images and augmenting it with real time processing of data from social media (mostly tweets) to improve the prediction and detection of natural disasters and subsequent dissemination of alerts among the residents of the affected regions through sms to help areas with poor or non-existent internet connectivity. 
We will deploy a deep learning model on Azure to continuosly analyse data from satellites and predict the occurence of classes of natural disasters. If there is enough evidence for an upcoming disaster, we inform the concerned authorities, and start monitoring tweets from the region, including analysing sentiments to ascertain the amount of damage and extracting key information to help on ground workers. We keep giving these updates through sms to people in that region. They have to have signed up beforehand to receive this. Additionally, we can have the provision of adding people in groups, to imitate facebook's safety check feature, but using sms and only informing the people in that group.
